# CollegeBoard2019
Hi! My name is Tommy Hang and this is my submission for College Board of 2019:

The application I made is a game meant for entertainment. 

Description:
You play as a character and try to dodge the meteors that rain from the sky. If the meteors touch you, you lose!

Within the public folder is the code for the game!

Watch a clip of my game running!
